# Hello World

This is my very first HTML file as part of my **Front-End Learning Progress** journey.

## ðŸ“Œ What I Learned
- The basic structure of an HTML document.
- The role of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- How browsers interpret and display HTML content.

## ðŸ“‚ File in this folder
- **hello-world.html** â†’ Displays a simple "Hello World" page.

## ðŸ–¥ Preview
When opened in a browser, this page shows:
- A big heading saying "Hello World!"
- A paragraph saying "This is my very first HTML page."
- A header saying "My Name Is Okusanya Samuel."
