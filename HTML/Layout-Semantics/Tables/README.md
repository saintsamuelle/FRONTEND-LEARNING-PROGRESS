## 📚 What I Learned
- `<table>` is used to start a table.
- `<tr>` is for table rows.
- `<th>` is for table headers (bold by default).
- `<td>` is for table data cells.
- `border="1"` adds a visible border to the table.
- `<caption>` adds a title to the table.
- `colspan` merges cells horizontally.
- `rowspan` merges cells vertically.
