## üìö What I Learned
- `<audio>` allows you to embed sound files with optional controls.
- `<video>` allows you to embed video files with optional controls.
- `controls` attribute adds play/pause, volume, and other buttons.
- `<source>` specifies the media file and type.
- Always provide fallback text for browsers that do not support the element.
